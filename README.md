# AUDIO-ASSIST
This project implements a real-time object detection system using YOLO (You Only Look Once) with voice feedback capabilities. The system captures video from a webcam, detects objects, and provides audio descriptions of the detected objects' locations and confidence levels.


Features:

Real-time object detection using YOLOv3

Voice feedback for detected objects

Position-aware detection (left/right/center and top/mid/bottom)

Confidence level reporting

Visual bounding boxes with labels

Support for 80 COCO dataset classes
